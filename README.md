I'm a 22 year old girl who is almost graduated out of college. I'm about to join a 150 year old non-profit organisation *Providence* as Assistant Developer. Also I want to establish my love for coding. I have worked with JavaScript,React Native, and various web technologies. I have done backend developement with NodeJS,VueJs. Machine Learning is yet another of my interests. I have also completed a deep learning specialization in coursera.
